# Pong

# Overview

This is a recreation of the game Pong in Unity. Use w and d or the arrow keys to move your paddle (on the left) and keep the ball from hitting your side of the screen. Get the ball past the computer's paddle on the right side to score.

This project was meant to help learn Unity and get into working with game engines.
